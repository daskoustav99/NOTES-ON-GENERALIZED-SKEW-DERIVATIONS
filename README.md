# NOTES-ON-GENERALIZED-SKEW-DERIVATIONS

Under this project work, our target is to generalize the concept of Jordan skew derivation by 
considering the situation 

𝐷( 𝑥
𝑛+1 ) = 𝐷(𝑥)𝑥
𝑛 + 𝛼(𝑥)𝐷(𝑥)𝑥
𝑛−1 + (𝛼(𝑥))
2
𝐷(𝑥)𝑥
𝑛−2 + ⋯ + (𝛼(𝑥))
𝑛
𝐷(𝑥)

where D is an additive mapping and 𝛼 is an automorphism of R. It is very clear that for n=1, 
D becomes a Jordan skew derivation.

Similarly, we generalize the concept of Jordan generalized skew derivation by considering 
the situation 

𝐹( 𝑥
𝑛+1 ) = 𝐹(𝑥)𝑥
𝑛 + 𝛼(𝑥)𝐷(𝑥)𝑥
𝑛−1 + (𝛼(𝑥))
2
𝐷(𝑥)𝑥
𝑛−2 + ⋯ + (𝛼(𝑥))
𝑛
𝐷(𝑥)

where F, D are additive mappings and 𝛼 is an automorphism of R. It is very clear that for 
n=1, D becomes a Jordan generalized skew derivation.

In this project work, we investigate these mappings and prove under some conditions when 
these mappings to be Jordan skew derivation or Jordan generalized skew derivation.
